    quickly debug and develop new features. Without syncing the bot command tree to a server, it
    can take an hour (or longer) for changes to trickle to all the servers the bot is in.

    It might be tempting to add the bot.tree.sync() line in bot.setup_hook().

    of new features when frequent restarts are necessary, you'll get rate-limited by Discord into next week.
