# Future Josh:
# It's tempting to symlink this to /etc/systemd/system; don't. :)

# If the service file is modified after it's started, the service can't be restarted until the daemon is
# manually reset, which the bot shouldn't be responsible for. This means you need to run
# sudo cp /home/pi/goonbot/bin/goonbot.service /etc/systemd/system; sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# any time you push a change that needs to be implemented
