# Goonbot & randomized responses
Randomized responses makes the bot feel a bit more dynamic, making interaction more interesting. This illusion of a bot saying something different each time you ask it breaks down when the same response is used back-to-back.

To prevent this, features that use randomization (wow no invite comments, rat, etc.) won't repeat content until all available options have been served to the users.
