# Twitter Embeds
This is a simple feature that checks new messages to see if any starts with twitter/x url. When it comes accross a tweet the bot will reply with the same tweet, but served through [FixTweet](https://github.com/FixTweet/FixTweet). FixTweet creates an embedded version of the tweet for discord (or Telegram if you're a weirdo). Works with images, videos, and even polls. You can even click on the link, which just redirects you to the actual tweet through your browser/app.

## Fun fact
FixTweet was seemingly authored by a furry. We can depend on this for years to come.
