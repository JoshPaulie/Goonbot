# Why another rewrite?
I started learning the `discord.py` library as a means of learning Python back in 2019. For the first few years I rewrote the bot frequently to better reflect my Python ability. There was a bit of a schism in the python discord botting community, which lead me to rewrite it with `Pycord` instead. This most recent rewrite (for this "last generation") is me returning home to `discord.py`
